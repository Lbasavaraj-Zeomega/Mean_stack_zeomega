									-------------Chatting with io Socket-----------
									
									
									
Tools used:
	Node JS: To develop a chat functionality using socket.io.

	Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub

	GitHub: To store your application
	
	
As per the requirements,
  I have developed a code ChatBot app .
  In this we can give user name and through the user name we can chat with user.
  In this I used scoket.io and express .
