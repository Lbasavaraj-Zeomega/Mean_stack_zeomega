                                                                   Chat App
				  
				  
				  
Tools used:
	SocketIo
	Mongodb
	Nodejs
	VS Code
	Express JS
	
	
1)Created the Private Chat app using nodejs socketio and mongodb
2)The front end interfaces used are html and css
3)The backend interface are nodejs and express
4)Socket.io for client and server side interactions
5)Mongodb is the database used for storing
6)JavaScript isused for both front and Backend
7)The app contains real-time chat between two private users
8)The chat history can be retirieved later when the chat is accessed by the user
9)The chat between two people will not be broadcasted to other users online
10)If an active user sends a message to another user while he is offline, the other user will be able to retirieve message later when he accesses the chat
11)We also need to install dependencies like mongoodb,express,moment,socket.io,nodemon
12)The nodemon is used for running the server continuously
13)once we run the command npm start the server is connected on the port 5000
14)After server connection using browser we need search in path localhost:5000/chat.html
15)It'll display a form which shows "from" , "to","chat". 
16)After clicking on "chat" ,It"ll take to the private chat room.
17)And it'll display all the messages.
