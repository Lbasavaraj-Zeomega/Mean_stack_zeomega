									-------------Call Record Anlysis-----------
									
									
									
Tools used:
	MongoDB: A NoSQL database

	MongoDB concepts: Scaling, replication, relationships, and operations in MongoDB

	call_data.json file provided on LMS
	
Data should contain following columns

	Source: Phone number of caller

	Destination: Phone number of call receiver

	Source_location: Caller’s city

	Destination_location: Call receiver’s city

	Call_duration: Phone call duration

	Roaming:  Flag to check if caller is in roaming

	Call_charge: Money charged for call

As per the requirements,
  I have wrote the Querys for all problem .
  In this 1st i have created database  and created the collection after that  imported the database call_data.json.
  Create database in MangoDb:
	-->use call_record_anlysis;
	Create collection call_data:
		-->db.createCollection('call_data');
	import call_data.json file in that bd
		--> mongoimport --db call_record_anlysis --collection call_data < C:\Users\lbasavaraj\Desktop\Basavaraj_Zeomega\Training\Mean_phase-3\Call_Record_Anlyasis\call_data.json --jsonArry
	

	performe following task:
		1.Insert 1 record in database;
			--> db.call_data.insert({"source" : "+919612345670", "destination" : "+919612345671", "source_location": "Delhi", "destination_location": "Mumbai", "call_duration": 2.03, "roaming": "false", "call_charge":2.03 })
		
		2.Cehck total number of call made roaming(roaming=true):
			-->db.call_data.find( {call_duration : {$gt :10.00} }).count()
	
		3.Count of call with call duration > 10 minutes:
			--> db.call_data.find({roaming:"true"}).count()
  

  
 Thank you!
